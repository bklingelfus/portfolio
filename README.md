<!-- HTML -->
In the HTML I used a lot of divs for the flexboxes used in CSS;
    Divided the main body in 3 parts (header/main content/footer);
<!-- JS / jQUERY -->
As a main tool for most of the functions created with JS/jQuery I prepared "spare" parts that woul be connect
    For the rotation of things, buttons, main display, carousel etc 
        used display none for the rest and display flex/block for the first of type
        simply rotate the one I wanted to the front in order to change display

    For the color change I did dumb way of connecting a lot of variables and reconnecting them depending on whether it is dark/light mode
<!-- CSS -->
for most of the work used flexboxes 
For the animations used CSS used the transition and keyframed feature
 And used simple media query for adjusting things according to size
